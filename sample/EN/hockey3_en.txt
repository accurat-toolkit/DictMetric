Vancouver (AFP) - Jarome Iginla made the most of his limited playing time, starting out with a bit part in the Canadian offence before working his way to the marquee line alongside superstar Sidney Crosby.

Iginla is used to logging 20 minutes a game with the Calgary Flames but he scored three goals in just nine minutes and 48 seconds of playing time in Canada's 8-0 opening game win over Norway at the Vancouver Olympic Games.

"It's pretty exciting to play with Sidney," said Iginla who was switched to Croby's line after just one period. 

"He (coach Mike Babcock) talked to us before about what line combinations to expect before the game and to be ready (to switch to other lines)."

Iginla's gritty performance on Tuesday pretty much guarantees he will get play a bigger role in Canada's next game against Switzerland on Thursday.

Iginla is one of four Canadians who played on the gold medal winning team in Salt Lake Olympic Games. The others are goalie Martin Brodeur, defenceman Scott Niedermayer and defenceman Pronger.

In Salt Lake, Iginla took a back seat to Canadian sniper Joe Sakic but with 'Burnaby' Joe now retired it looks like Iginla could be ready to drive the offence in 2010.

"I talked to Iggy at the start. We need him to be a physical presence for us," Babcock said.

Up next for Canada is Switzerland and the Canucks will be looking for some payback after being upset 2-0 by the Swiss at the Torino 2006 Games.

"It was four years ago, but we can remember how we felt afterwards." Iginla said. "Yeah, I want to beat them badly too.

"Four years ago sounds like a long time ago, but it doesn't once you're here."

Iginla said the Swiss will try to out work Canada.

"They have a good skating team, they work hard and they compete hard and they'll be strong defensively," he said.
